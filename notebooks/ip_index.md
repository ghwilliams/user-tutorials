Induced Polarization
======================

Induced polarization data are simulated using functionality within the ``SimPEG.electromagnetics.static.induced_polarization`` module. Here, we provide a multitude of introductory and indermediate level tutorials for forward simulation and inversion of induced polarization data. Links to each tutorial can be accessed below or from the left-side menu.
