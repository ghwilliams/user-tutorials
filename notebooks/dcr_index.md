Direct Current Resistivity
======================

Direct current resistivity data are simulated using functionality within the ``SimPEG.electromagnetics.static.resistivity`` module. Here, we provide a multitude of introductory and indermediate level tutorials for forward simulation and inversion of direct current resistivity data. Links to each tutorial can be accessed below or from the left-side menu.
