    "### General Approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary electromagnetic fields produced by controlled sources fall off very quickly with respect to distance. For example, the primary magnetic field produced by a magnetic dipole source falls off as $r^{-3}$. Because the amplitude and direction of the primary fields varies greatly close to the source, smaller cells are needed there to model the fields accurately. Far away from the source, larger cells can be used since the fields are much smoother. Tree meshes are well-suited for TDEM simulations because the cell size can be increased at specified distances from controlled sources. For any controlled source TDEM simulation, we advise the following considerations and rules of thumb:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The smallest cell size used to discretize the Earth should be at most 1/2 of the diffusion distance for the earliest time channel.\n",
    "2. To impose the boundary conditions properly, the padding thickness should be at least 2-3 times the diffusion distance for the latest time channel and background conductivity. You must also pad upwards into the air.\n",
    "3. Successive increases in cell size should not happen too abruptly. Within your volume of interest, you should have 4 layers of cells of the same size before increasing the cell size.\n",
    "4. You generally need to have several cells between the source and receiver in order to simulate the primary signal at the receiver accurately. This is less problematic when data are measured during the off-time\n",
    "5. Finer discretization is required when topography is significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important:** because the diffusion distance depends on observation time and electrical conductivity, we must know something about the subsurface physical properties as well as the survey properties prior to designing our mesh."

    "- the survey\n",
    "- the mesh\n",
    "- the mapping from the model to the mesh\n",
    "\n",
    "This is accomplished by setting each one of the aforementioned items as a property of the simulation object. Here, we define two simulation objects, one where the model defines the subsurface conductivities, and one where the model defines subsurface log-resistivities. When our model is used to define subsurface electric conductivity, the mapping is set using the ``sigmaMap`` keyword argument. However when our model is used to define subsurface electric resistivity, the mapping must be set using the ``rhoMap`` keyword argument.\n",
